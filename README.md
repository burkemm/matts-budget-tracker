**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I created an app that allows a person to track their money. They can add income and purchases to calculate how much fudns they have in 
their personal budget. This is good for paying bills and keeping up with your cashflow.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned how to make an app that works on the front end and the back end. I went through diffictulties getting it deployed on Heroku, but I 
was able to get it to work. This was a difficult assignment, but I was able to get what I needed done.
